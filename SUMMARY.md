**DeepBacs: Escherichia coli antibiotic phenotyping object detection dataset and YOLOv2 model** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the biomedical research. 

The dataset consists of 235 images with 3564 labeled objects belonging to 8 different classes including *Oblique*, *Vesicle*, *Nalidixate*, and other: *Rifampicin*, *CAM*, *Control*, *Mecillinam*, and *MP265*.

Images in the DeepBacs E. Coli dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (153 images), *test_individual_treatment* (50 images), and *test_stitched_images* (32 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the Institute of Physical and Theoretical Chemistry, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Germany.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
